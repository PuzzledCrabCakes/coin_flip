This was a project to see how many times a coin could consecutively land on heads
in a given amount. In this case, the total count was {total_count}. A total of {head_count}
coins landed on heads, giving a final percentage of {percentage}. The largest streak of heads, or
the consecutive amount of heads, was {top_count} which is about a {round(prob, 10)}% chance. 
This process took roughly {tot_time} second.
